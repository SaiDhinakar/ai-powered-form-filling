# AI-Powered Form Filling Assistant for Indian Citizen Services

## **Core PS**

Citizens in India often need to **fill multiple government forms** (for certificates, licenses, welfare schemes) at  **Seva Kendras** . Manually filling forms is slow, repetitive, and error-prone because the same personal details (name, DOB, address, Aadhaar, PAN, voter ID numbers) are typed again and again.

The project aims to build an **AI assistant** that can:

* Take **existing documents** (Aadhaar, PAN, voter ID, etc.).
* **Extract key fields automatically** (entity extraction).
* **Map those fields into government service form templates** (auto-fill).
* Let the user **review and edit** before final submission.

This reduces manual work for citizens and Seva Kendra operators.

## What is Seva Kendra ?


**Seva Kendras** (also called  **Common Service Centres – CSCs** ) are physical service points set up by the Government of India under the  **Digital India programme** .

They act as **one-stop service delivery centres** for citizens, especially in rural and semi-urban areas, to access various **government and non-government services online** without needing to visit government offices.

* Provide services like  **ration card, voter ID, PAN, Aadhaar linking, pensions, scholarships, licenses** .
* Facilitate  **bill payments, banking, insurance, railway ticket booking, exam registrations** .

### **How They Work**

* Citizens go to a Seva Kendra.
* Operator (called a  **Village Level Entrepreneur – VLE** ) logs into the CSC portal.
* Citizen provides documents (Aadhaar, PAN, etc.).
* Operator fills the required online forms on government portals using those documents.
* Final certificates/applications are printed and given to the citizen.

### **Problem**
